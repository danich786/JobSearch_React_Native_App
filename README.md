# JobSearch_React_Native_App

This application uses the Google JSearch API to fetch results about the user's search for a job. This application is developed using React Native and provides cross-platform support for both Android and IOS. It is only for reflecting my application development skills and thatâ€™s why it is not submitted on Play Store or Google Play.

I have used Expo for building and testing purposes. I have deployed the source code of this application on AWS Cloud and using Expo to host the application on AWS EC2 service. I am using the Expo Go app on my IOS device to illustrate the working of this application.
