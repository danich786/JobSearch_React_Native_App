# react_native_jobs

This application uses the Google JSearch API to fetch results about the user search for a job. This application is developed using React Native and provides cross-platform support for both Android and IOS. It is only for reflecting my application development skills and thatâ€™s why it is not submitted on play-store or google-play.

I have used Expo for building and testing purposes. I have deployed this application on AWS Cloud using EC2 service and using Expo Go mobile application for illustration of working of this application
